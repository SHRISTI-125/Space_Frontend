      <p style="padding: 15px; color: whitesmoke;">Supernovas are powerful explosions marking the end of a star's life cycle. They occur when stars exhaust their nuclear fuel, 
        leading to a core collapse or thermonuclear explosion. They also trigger the formation of new stars and planets. </p>
      <br><h2 style="padding: 10px; color: white;">The Process of a Supernova Explosion</h2>
      <p style="padding: 15px; color: whitesmoke;">
        <ol>
            <li style="color: whitesmoke;">A massive star (typically 8â€“25 times the mass of the Sun) runs out of nuclear fuel.
                Without energy from fusion to counteract gravity, the starâ€™s core becomes unstable. Star reaches to it's end life.</li>
                <li style="color: whitesmoke;">The core, primarily made of iron, cannot undergo fusion to produce energy.
                    Gravity overwhelms the core, causing it to collapse to an incredibly dense state in milliseconds.</li>
            <li style="color: whitesmoke;">
                The outer layers of the star fall inward at high speed and hit the dense core.
                This impact creates a shock wave that rebounds outward through the starâ€™s material.
            </li>
            <li style="color: whitesmoke;">The shock wave ejects the star's outer layers into space in a massive explosion.
                The event releases tremendous energy, making the star temporarily as bright as a galaxy.</li>
            <li style="color: whitesmoke;">
                If the remaining core is less than 3 times the Sun's mass, it becomes a neutron star.
                If it's more massive, the core collapses further into a black hole.
            </li>
            <li style="color: whitesmoke;">
                The explosion disperses elements like carbon, oxygen, and iron into the interstellar medium.
                Heavier elements, such as gold and uranium, are formed during the explosion through nucleosynthesis.
            </li>
            <li style="color: whitesmoke;">
                The ejected material expands outward, forming a nebula (e.g., the Crab Nebula).
                These remnants enrich the surrounding space, fueling the formation of new stars and planets.
