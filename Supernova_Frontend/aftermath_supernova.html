        <h1 style="color: rgb(249, 209, 242); padding: 10px; font: 2.5em sans-serif;"><b>Aftermath of Supernovas</b></h1>
      <p style="padding: 15px; color: rgb(147, 184, 251);">The aftermath of a supernova is as fascinating as the explosion itself, leaving behind remnants and forming celestial objects that shape the universe.
        Supernovas serve as standard candles for measuring distances in the universe.
        They also provide insight into galaxy evolution, black hole formation, and the distribution of elements.
        The aftermath of a supernova is not just the death of a starâ€”itâ€™s a transformative event that enriches the 
        universe, drives cosmic evolution, and enables the formation of new celestial objects and even life itself.

      <p style="padding: 15px; color: white;"> Steps : 
        <ol>
            <li style="color: whitesmoke;"><b>Formation of Stellar Remnants : </b>
                The supernovaâ€™s collapsed core can result in one of the following:
                <br>
                âœ¨ Neutron Star : If the coreâ€™s mass is less than 3 times the Sunâ€™s mass, it compresses into a neutron star.
                A neutron star is incredibly dense, with the mass of the Sun packed into a sphere just 10-15 km in diameter.<br>
                âœ¨ Black Hole : If the core's mass exceeds the neutron star limit, it collapses into a black hole.
                Black holes are regions of spacetime with gravity so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape.<br>
            </li>
                <li style="color: whitesmoke;">
                    <b>Ejection of Supernova Remnants : </b><br>
                    âœ¨ The explosion ejects the star's outer layers into space at incredible speeds.<br>
                    âœ¨ This material forms a glowing shell of gas and dust called a supernova remnant.<br>
                </li>
            <li style="color: whitesmoke;">
                <b>Element Enrichment : </b><br>
                âœ¨ Supernovas scatter heavy elements (like carbon, oxygen, iron, and gold) into the interstellar medium.<br>
            </li>
            <li style="color: whitesmoke;">
                <b>Triggering Star Formation : </b><br>
                âœ¨ The shock waves from the explosion can compress nearby gas clouds, triggering the birth of new stars.<br>
                âœ¨ This process contributes to the dynamic lifecycle of galaxies.<br>
            </li>
            <li style="color: whitesmoke;">
                <b> Impact on Surrounding Environment : </b><br>
                âœ¨ Supernova remnants emit X-rays and radio waves that scientists study to understand their composition.<br>
                âœ¨ The energy released alters the structure of the interstellar medium, influencing nearby star systems.<br>
            </li>
            <li style="color: whitesmoke;">
                <b>Light Echoes and Observability : </b><br>
                âœ¨ The light from the supernova can reflect off nearby interstellar dust, creating light echoes that persist for years.<br>
                âœ¨ These echoes allow astronomers to study the supernova long after the initial explosion.
